👋 Hi, I’m Adewale.

👀 I’m interested in exploring the latest JavaScript frameworks, building interactive web applications, and diving deep into Node.js development.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced JavaScript concepts such as async/await, functional programming, and modern ES features.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to front-end development, Node.js libraries, and full-stack applications.
